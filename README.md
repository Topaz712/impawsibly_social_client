# ImpawsiblySocialClient

This repository is the front-end for my back-end api repository which can be found [here](https://github.com/Topaz712/impawsibly_social_api)

## Repository's Purpose

Welcome to the repository for my Social Media Pet App! This repository was made for the front end of my application, to provide a visually engaging user interface for pet owners to connect and share their furry pet pals adventures!

### Target Audience

I created this application with pet owners in mind, I wanted to allow anyone who wants to showcase their beloved pets, schedule playdates with other loveable pet pals and even join a playdate that has already been posted. This will give pet owners the opportunity to interact with other owners as their pet pals have a fun time playing with their new friends

### What can it do?

A user will be able to register their owner account which will let them create and manage a single/multiple pet profiles, request to schedule a playdate with another pet, join an ongoing public playdate, upload pet pictures to each designated profile, leave comments on a post, and send friend requests. This is a social media pet app.

## Front end architecture

This app has a dashboard where pet owners can navigate through different sections of the app. Users can sign up and log in to access their personalized profiles, where they can add, view, and update pet profiles with details like name, species, breed, and more.. The playdate feature allows users to create and join playdate events, either for specific pets or for all their pets at once. Additionally, users can post pictures and send friend requests to other pet owners, fostering a sense of community and connection among pet lovers

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.1.
